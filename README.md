# Sample Employee Databases SQL Challenge

For this project, I designed the tables to hold the data from CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered questions about the data. 

**Data Modeling**

Inspected the six CSV files, and then sketched an ERD of the tables.

**Data Engineering**

Created a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Specified the data types, primary keys, and foreign keys. 

Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

**Data Analysis**

List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
